# Tomoko-Homepage

![alt tag](screenshot.JPG "Homepage preview")
**Live Demo: [Here] (http://windowsfag.github.io/Tomoko-Homepage/) NOTE: For whatever reason the background image wont load in the live demo. Or atleast it wont in Pale Moon.**

A fork of gokoururi homepage for anybody who feels like using something broken. I settled on a theme of Tomoko Kuroki for literally no reason at all. The main differnece between this and Gokoururi's homepage is the Tomoko theme and the wallpaper background.

#Non Firefox users
I like to dick around with the CSS by enabling effects that only appear when I launch with Chrome, so never. You can go ahead and easily delete these if you don't like them. They're all experimental and made when I'm bored.

Feel free to change, fork, edit, redistribute, sell on the black market or whatever.
